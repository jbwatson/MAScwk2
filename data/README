% PREPARE

1) Edit the option at line 26 of proxdd.pl so it points to your data dir.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% LOADING

Two options:

1) Load sicstus as normal and then just consult or compile proxdd.pl
        % sicstus -l proxdd.pl
   or
        % sicstus
        ...
        ?- [proxdd].
   or
        % sicstus
        ...
        ?- compile(proxdd).
   If you do this from the proxdd/code/ directory, then it will set
   things up to look in the proxdd/data/ directory for source files.

2) Use the script 'proxdd' provided.  This needs to go somewhere in your path,
   and the variables at lines 9 and 13 need to be edited to point to the
   SICStus executable and the directory where proxdd.pl is.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% USING

1) To get some help on the screen, do:
        ?- help.

2) To load source files (say, 'source.pl'), do:
        ?- loadf(source).

3) To make a query for some sentence 's', do:
        ?- sxdd(s, A).
   ('A' will be bound to the answer).

4) To print the steps of the derivation verbosely, do:
        ?- set_verbose

5) To switch to grounded semantics, do:
        ?- set_gb.

6) To switch to admissible semantics, do:
        ?- set_ab.

%
% VISUALIZE USING GRAPHVIZ

Suppose your source file is 'source.pl'.

1) To output solutions to a file which can be drawn by graphviz, do:
        ?- set_print.
        ?- sxdd(s, A).  [where 's' is your query]

2) Then, there should be output a file something like 'source_sol_1.dot'.
   Do (in the shell):
        % dot -Tps -o source_sol_1.ps source_sol_1.dot
        % evince source_sol_1.ps &
